# Contributing to Lightbend Telemetry Samples

## Synching with upstream projects

There is a script that syncs upstream samples projects here. Keep in mind it does not handle any conflicts, and only copies the most recent changes here. It is up to you to manually review the differences, and merge them accordingly.

## Pull requests

The project uses Lightbend Commercial Bintray repositories, and then need such repositories to be configured as secrets. Therefore, you MUST open pull requests using branches in this repository instead of forks.
