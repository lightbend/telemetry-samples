# Lightbend Telemetry Samples

[Lightbend Telemetry](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/telemetry/current/home.html) is a suite of insight tools that provides a view into the workings of our distributed platforms. This view allows developers and operations to respond quickly to problems, track down unexpected behavior and even tune your system. As a result, you can deploy your applications to production with confidence.

Lightbend Telemetry provides insight into applications built with [Lightbend technologies](https://developer.lightbend.com/start/). It does so by [instrumenting frameworks and toolkits such as Akka](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/telemetry/current/instrumentations/akka/akka.html). The instrumentation is done by a Java agent that runs when your application is starting up. Lightbend Telemetry collects information, in runtime, about your application based on a configuration that you must provide.

## Samples

This repository contains sample projects that show how to use Lightbend Telemetry together with Akka, and Lagom.
